Spartan6-LX9 MICROBoard Getting started with Linux Embedded

PetaLogix Linux --> PetaLinux + uBoot

- if one wants to try a dry run with non persistent bootloader and os just use

		$ cd non-persistent-run
		$./flash_non_persistent_run.sh

	# ensure that dhcp server is up and kernel image is in /tftpboot
	# in this case the first stage bootloader pulls the uboot from flash memory
	# into the DDR RAM and runs it;
	# next the uboot pulls the remote / tftp accessbile kernel+dtb+fs image into
	# RAM to be executed
	# the board boots up and after reset the current application is not erased 

- if one wants to flash the uboot in the SPI Flash memory and ERASE the existing content use
		
		$ cd persistent_run
		$ ./flash_uboot.sh

	# this way the bootloader is written into the Flash memory and will be persistent
	# the current parameters are to search for a linux image on the tftpboot and if it's
	# no offer available reads the next flash memory addresses to find a kernel
	
	# if the tftpboot approach is used ensure that the image.ub is in /tftpboot and the 
	# dhcp server is started and configured for the bootp transfer

	# if one wants to flash also the kernel in the flash memory when entering uboot cmdline use:	
		>> run update_kernel
		
	# this will write the image in the flash and it will be always booting
	
	# the image contains a device tree (dtb), the kernel and a ramdisk with the rootfs

 A nice application found in the Linux rootfs is a webserver with configuration capabilities.
